This is where pointers get a bit confusing for most people, because it is hard to wrap our minds around the concept
of something pointing to something else, and that thing is pointing to something else as well.

And this chain continues until we reach the final thing which is not pointing to anything.

Take this code for example

int num = 10;
int* pNum = &num; 
int** spNum = &pnum;

Now the reason we add 2 stard in spNum is to indicate to the compiler that the address stored in this pointer can be 
de-refrenced two times.

int*** tpNum = &spNum;

Here three stars indicate to the compiler that we can de-refrence this pointer 3 times. 

So generally speaking the number of *'s you see attached to a pointer indicated how many times you can de-refrence the address stored
in that pointer.

And the reason you can't do something like 

int num = 10;
int* pNum = &num;
int* spNum = &pNUm;

Is because memory address have a type in C/C++, and you can't store a memory address of type int** into a int* variable.

But how is it decided that what is the type of the memory address at any random data slot?

Here is how it works, if the data stored in a data slot is something normal like an int, char etc. then
the memory address of that data slot will have a type of int* or char* depending on the type of data it stores.

When you want to assign a pointer to point to this address, it will be of type int* or char* as well, 
but the memory address of this pointer will now have int** or char** as its data type,

and now if you want to assign a second pointer to point to the int*, char* pointer, then you need to assign
int** or char** as its data type, otherwise it wil not work. 

And so on.

Basically the data slot type and the memory address type follows this formula.

memory_address_type = data_slot_type + *

of if data_slot_type = int
then memory_address_type = int + * = int*

if data_slot_type = int*
then memory_address_type = int* + * = int**

and so on

And the formula for knowing how many times you can de-refrence a variable is

ALLOWED_DEREFRENCE_TIMES = Number of *'s in data_slot_type

so if data_slot_type = int
then ALLOWED_DEREFRENCE_TIMES = 0

if data_slot_type = int*
then ALLOWED_DEREFRENCE_TIMES = 1

if data_slot_type = int**
then ALLOWED_DEREFRENCE_TIMES = 2

and so on.
