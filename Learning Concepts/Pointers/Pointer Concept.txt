A pointer is a type of variable which holds an address, what is an address you ask?

Well everything is stored somewhere in your computer, but how does your program know
where to look for things when it needs it, so each data slot has an address assigned to it,
which is just a number, usually it is written in hexadecimal like 0x120f3a or something.

A pointer itself has an address and the data slot which is assigned to that pointer, contains 
an address.

When we de-refrence a pointer like int num = 10; int* pNum= &num; printf("%d", *pNum);

It will access the data stored in the address that it itself is storing in its own data slot.

NOTE:  & returns the address of anything, normal variable or pointers alike
       * is used to define a pointer as well as de-refrence it.
